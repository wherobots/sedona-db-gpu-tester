# GPU Acceleration for Spatial Join

SedonaDB supports GPU-accelerated spatial joins with NVIDIA GPUs. The
key innovation is using NVIDIA RT cores for spatial query acceleration, which significantly reduces
candidate search cost and predicate evaluation.

> **Prerequisites:** GPU acceleration requires a SedonaDB build with GPU support, NVIDIA CUDA 12+
> on a GPU with compute capability 7.5 or higher.
> The feature works with or without dedicated RT cores. When RT cores are not available, NVIDA OptiX
> emulates ray tracing on CUDA cores.

## Why This Matters

Spatial joins are often bottlenecked by candidate generation and exact refinement. SedonaDB's GPU
path targets both phases:

- RT-core acceleration for high-throughput spatial filtering.
- A geometry-aware refinement pipeline, including a heavily optimized point-in-polygon (PIP) path.

## Filtering and Refining Stages

The GPU-based join follows SedonaDB's two-stage execution model:

1. **Filtering stage**
   - Runs on NVIDIA RT cores [1].
   - Quickly generates candidate geometry pairs that intersect.

2. **Refining stage**
   - Runs exact predicate checks on candidates.
   - For point-polygon geometry pairs, refinement is heavily optimized and accelerated with RT-core-backed
     ray-tracing techniques [2].
   - For other spatial join patterns, refinement runs on CUDA-core kernels. We will gradually expand the RT acceleration coverage in future releases.

## Supported Predicates and Fallback Behavior

GPU spatial join currently supports relation predicates:

- `ST_Intersects`
- `ST_Contains`
- `ST_Within`
- `ST_Covers`
- `ST_CoveredBy`
- `ST_Touches`
- `ST_Equals`

Not currently supported on the GPU path:

- Distance predicates (for example, `ST_DWithin`)
- KNN / KNN join predicates
- GeometryCollection

When `gpu.fallback_to_cpu = true` (default), unsupported predicates fall back to CPU spatial join.
When `gpu.fallback_to_cpu = false`, unsupported predicates fail the query.

## Install from Source with the GPU Feature
**Build from source**

For building the Python package from source, you should enable the GPU at build time and configure the CUDA
environment before running `MATURIN_PEP517_ARGS="--features='gpu,s2geography,pyo3/extension-module' pip install`.

Common environment variables used by the GPU build:

- `CUDA_HOME`: points to your CUDA toolkit root.
- `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`: CUDA SM targets (default falls back to `86` if not set; You can specify multiple arcs, e.g., "86;89"). Change this according to your [GPU models](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda/gpus). **Otherwise, it requires JIT to compile kernels, making the first-time run very slow!**

- `LIBGPUSPATIAL_LOGGING_LEVEL`: Logging level, including `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`.
- `GPUSPATIAL_PROFILING=ON`: Profiling mode (`ON`, `OFF`) to compile profiling instrumentation.

**Using Docker**

A prebuilt, GPU-enabled image is published to Docker Hub at [`apache/sedona`](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/sedona/tags) under the `sedonadb-latest` tag (built for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`). It bundles SedonaDB with the GPU feature enabled and starts a JupyterLab instance.

Make sure you have installed Docker, the NVIDIA Driver, and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit (`sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker`), then pull and run the image:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --gpus all -p 8888:8888 apache/sedona:sedonadb-latest
```

Open the JupyterLab URL printed in the terminal to start working.

The prebuilt image is compiled for the Turing, Ampere, and Ada Lovelace architectures (`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=75;86;89`), covering common NVIDIA GPUs such as the T4, A10G, and L4. On a GPU outside this set the kernels are JIT-compiled on first use, which can make the first run slow. To target your own GPU, build the image from the repository root:

```bash
docker build -f docker/sedonadb-gpu.dockerfile --build-arg CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="<your GPU compute capability>" -t sedonadb-gpu .
docker run -it --rm --gpus all -p 8888:8888 sedonadb-gpu
```

> **Note:** This Docker image is currently source-built directly from the repository's active codebase and is not tied to a released SedonaDB GPU wheel yet. This is to support development and early testing before an official SedonaDB GPU wheel is published.

## Enable GPU Join with SQL `SET`

The GPU join is disabled by default even if you enabled the GPU feature at build time. To enable GPU acceleration for spatial joins, set the `gpu.enable` option to `true`:


```python
import sedonadb

ctx = sedonadb.connect()

ctx.sql("SET gpu.enable = true").execute()
```




    <sedonadb.dataframe.DataFrame object at 0x70b85c1b7850>



## Performance Tuning and Special Cautions

To keep the GPU efficiently utilized, use larger execution batches:


```python
ctx.sql("SET datafusion.execution.batch_size = 100000").execute()
```

Important guidance:

- A large batch size (for example, `100000`) is often necessary for good GPU throughput.
- For highest GPU performance, spilling should be disabled (for example, set `sd.options.memory_limit = "unlimited"` before running queries).
- Small joins may not amortize GPU overhead and can be slower than CPU execution.
- Start with defaults for other `gpu.*` options, then tune based on measured workload behavior.

## GPU Options

The following session options are available under the `gpu.` prefix:

- `gpu.enable` (bool, default `false`): enable GPU spatial join.
- `gpu.concat_build` (bool, default `true`): concatenate geometry buffers before GPU processing.
- `gpu.device_id` (int, default `0`): CUDA device ID.
- `gpu.fallback_to_cpu` (bool, default `true`): use CPU path when GPU path is unavailable/unsupported.
- `gpu.use_memory_pool` (bool, default `true`): use CUDA memory pool.
- `gpu.memory_pool_init_percentage` (int, default `50`): initial CUDA memory pool size as a percentage of total GPU memory.
- `gpu.pipeline_batches` (int, default `1`): overlap parsing and refinement across batches.
- `gpu.compress_bvh` (bool, default `false`): compress BVH to reduce memory usage (can reduce performance).

Example:


```python
import sedonadb

ctx = sedonadb.connect()

ctx.sql("SET gpu.enable = true")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.device_id = 0")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.use_memory_pool = true")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.memory_pool_init_percentage = 60")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.pipeline_batches = 2")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.compress_bvh = false")
ctx.sql("SET datafusion.execution.batch_size = 100000").execute()
```

""")
ctx.sql("""
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE trip
    STORED AS PARQUET
    LOCATION 'hf-data/v0.1.0/sf1/trip/'
""").execute()
```




    0



### Define query


```python
# Define the query once to ensure both executions use the exact same logic
query = """
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cross_zone_trip_count
FROM trip t
    JOIN zone pickup_zone
        ON ST_Within(ST_GeomFromWKB(t.t_pickuploc), ST_GeomFromWKB(pickup_zone.z_boundary))
    JOIN zone dropoff_zone
        ON ST_Within(ST_GeomFromWKB(t.t_dropoffloc), ST_GeomFromWKB(dropoff_zone.z_boundary))
WHERE pickup_zone.z_zonekey != dropoff_zone.z_zonekey
"""
```

First, we will run this query using the standard CPU execution to establish our baseline correctness and get a sense of the standard execution time.


```python
import time

print("Executing on CPU (Baseline)...")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.enable = false")  # Disable the GPU feature
ctx.sql("SET datafusion.execution.batch_size = 8192")  # Default configuration

runs = 5
cpu_times = []
cpu_count = 0

for i in range(runs):
    start_time = time.time()
    cpu_df = ctx.sql(query).to_pandas()
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time

    cpu_times.append(elapsed)
    cpu_count = cpu_df.iloc[0, 0]
    print(f"  Run {i + 1}: {elapsed:.4f} seconds")

cpu_avg_time = sum(cpu_times) / runs
print("-" * 30)
print(f"CPU Average Time: {cpu_avg_time:.4f} seconds | Rows: {cpu_count}")
```

    Executing on CPU (Baseline)...
      Run 1: 7.7795 seconds
      Run 2: 6.8287 seconds
      Run 3: 7.0688 seconds
      Run 4: 7.2434 seconds
      Run 5: 7.1739 seconds
    ------------------------------
    CPU Average Time: 7.2189 seconds | Rows: 176391


Next, we enable GPU execution. We also increase the batch size, which is a crucial optimization step to ensure we are feeding enough data to the GPU to maximize its parallel processing capabilities.


```python
print("Executing on GPU (Accelerated)...")
ctx.sql("SET gpu.enable = true")
ctx.sql("SET datafusion.execution.batch_size = 1000000")  # Optimized for GPU throughput

runs = 5
gpu_times = []
gpu_count = 0

for i in range(runs):
    start_time = time.time()
    gpu_df = ctx.sql(query).to_pandas()
    elapsed = time.time() - start_time

    gpu_times.append(elapsed)
    gpu_count = gpu_df.iloc[0, 0]
    print(f"  Run {i + 1}: {elapsed:.4f} seconds")

gpu_avg_time = sum(gpu_times) / runs
print("-" * 30)
print(f"GPU Average Time: {gpu_avg_time:.4f} seconds | Rows: {gpu_count}")
```

    Executing on GPU (Accelerated)...
      Run 1: 3.2582 seconds
      Run 2: 3.3126 seconds
      Run 3: 3.0703 seconds
      Run 4: 3.2604 seconds
      Run 5: 3.1418 seconds
    ------------------------------
    GPU Average Time: 3.2087 seconds | Rows: 176391


### Compare Results


```python
# Validate correctness
match_status = "✅ Match" if cpu_count == gpu_count else "❌ Mismatch"

# Calculate speedup based on the new averages
speedup = cpu_avg_time / gpu_avg_time if gpu_avg_time > 0 else 0

print("--- Query Validation (Based on Averages) ---")
print(f"Row Count Validated : {gpu_count} ({match_status})")
print(f"Average CPU Time    : {cpu_avg_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Average GPU Time    : {gpu_avg_time:.4f}s")
print(f"Calculated Speedup  : {speedup:.2f}x")
```

    --- Query Validation (Based on Averages) ---
    Row Count Validated : 176391 (✅ Match)
    Average CPU Time    : 7.2189s
    Average GPU Time    : 3.2087s
    Calculated Speedup  : 2.25x
