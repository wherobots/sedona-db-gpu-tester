//! Zarr-backed N-D raster loader for SedonaDB.
//!
//! [`ZarrChunkReader`] is a `RecordBatchReader` that walks a Zarr
//! group's chunk grid lazily, emitting one raster row per chunk
//! position with one band per array. Each row carries a chunk-anchor
//! URI in `outdb_uri`; the `data` column stays empty. Metadata-only
//! operations (`count(*)`, `RS_Envelope`, `RS_Width`, …) work directly
//! against these rows; byte-consuming kernels need an async resolver
//! that's not part of this crate.
//!
//! Local filesystem stores only — `file://` URIs or bare paths.
